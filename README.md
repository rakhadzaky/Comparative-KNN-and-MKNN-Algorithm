Comparative KNN and MKNN Algorithm for Classification using Recall and F1

One of the popular classification technique is K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). And there is also the Modified K-Nearest Neighbor (MKNN) classification algorithm which is the derived algorithm of KNN.
Now we are going to compare 'Recall' and 'F1' from KNN and MKNN algorithm using "National Financial Well-Being Survey" dataset from kaggle.
